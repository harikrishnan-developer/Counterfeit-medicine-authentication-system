# Counterfeit Medicine Authentication System using Blockchain and IoT

The current pharmaceutical sector is dealing with several issues. The pharmaceuti-cal sector nowadays is dominated by counterfeit medications. Health research funding groups estimate that between 10 and 30 percent of the pharmaceuticals in the market are counterfeited. Globally, this fatal issue is creating several serious health risks. WHO estimates that 30 practi-cally every region of the world, this issue is becoming worse by the second. As drugs travel across several scattered networks, it is challenging to identify fakes. By integrating Blockchain technology into the network, the pharmaceutical supply chain may be made safer. Every area of the network keeps track of the medications through a record, making it possible to identify any introduction of fake medications. System transparency and dependability are improved with Blockchain security. By employing Blockchain technology, the initiative seeks to guaran-tee medicine quality, transaction security, and data protection. By eliminating information about expired and fake medications from the system, this effort increases system dependability and helps to make the Blockchain a stable and widely used technology. To determine whether or not counterfeit medications have been distributed, IOT technology is also employed.
